Ideally to include :
- A revised version and design of AMX Mod X + some existing AMXX Modules (intended for use with Half-Life mods AND Sven Co-op Version 5 where possible)
- A revised version and design of "Sven Co-op Experience Mod (SCXPM)" (intended for use with Half-Life mods AND Sven Co-op Version 5 where possible)
- A game library designed for use with multiple game engines (Concept and design by ModRiot.com) [may become independent C/C++ library]
- An AMX Mod X Module for use with various Half-Life 1 mods as well as the revised version of "SCXPM" AMXX plugin

For the modules

What is currently needed to build the program:
- Environment Variables "METAMOD" for use with Metamod-AM (from https://github.com/alliedmodders/metamod-hl1)
- Environment Variables "HLSDK" for use with Half-Life SDK (from https://github.com/alliedmodders/hlsdk)

Operating System and Compilers:
- Windows: Visual Studio >= 2010 (?) (I use Windows 7 + Visual Studio 2013 with Windows XP toolset, so only Visual Studio 2013 can be supported at this time)
- Linux: GCC 4.8 (the version for 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS seems to work decently enough)
- Mac: Unknown

For the plugins

- AMX Mod X 1.8.2 compiler
- "Include files" (*.inc extension) for use with plugins

 More information will be added over time.
